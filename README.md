# PEPL (Pointer-EimPL)
If you see this repo, solve the [N-Queens II](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/) problem, and post the solution as a comment. I will run various test cases, and check to see if it works. If it does, I will gift you $10. If it is in O(n), O(log(n)), or constant time, I will give you $15. The exception is that I will not tell you how the code works. Another reward is bragging rights on me, something that I assume most of you want. If the challenge is too hard, I will give you the language, and how to use it. I will call off the challenge after this. Good luck. *Hint: Check the regex expressions, bin_oper, checkType, getType, and bin_oper_mut. These are the most important items for this challenge. I also recommend that you solve the N-Queens II problem beforehand.*
