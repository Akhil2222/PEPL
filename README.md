# PEPL (Pointer-EimPL)
If you see this repo, solve the N-Queens problem, and post the solution as a comment. I will run various test cases, and check to see if it works. If it does, I will gift you $10. If it is in n, log(n) or constant time, I will give you $15. The exception is that I will not tell you how the code words. Another reward is bragging rights on me, something that I assume most of you want. Good luck.
